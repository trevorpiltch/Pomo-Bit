# Pomo-Bit
## About
The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a productivity technique with 25 minutes of deep work followed by 5 minutes of rest. It's
helpful to split up complex tasks and prevent those times where you sit down to do something and then two hours go by and nothings
actually been done.<br>
This project takes the [MicroBit v2](https://microbit.org/) and converts it into a simple pomodoro timer. The display indicates 
how many minutes are left, and at the end of a session, simply turn off your microbit and turn it back on to restart work. Use the left button
to toggle pause/play states in case you need to step away from your work.
